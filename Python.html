          <p>Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code
            readability with the use of significant indentation via the off-side rule.
            Python is dynamically typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including
            structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a
            "batteries included" language due to its comprehensive standard library.
            Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language
            and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.Python 2.0 was released in 2000. Python 3.0, released in 2008,
            was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2.7.18, released in
            2020, was the last release of Python 2.
            Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages</p>

          <p>Python was conceived in the late 1980s by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the
            Netherlands as a successor to the ABC programming language, which was inspired by SETL, capable of exception
            handling and interfacing with the Amoeba operating system. Its implementation began in December 1989. Van
            Rossum shouldered sole responsibility for the project, as the lead developer, until 12 July 2018, when he
            announced his "permanent vacation" from his responsibilities as Python's "benevolent dictator for life", a
            title the Python community bestowed upon him to reflect his long-term commitment as the project's chief
            decision-maker.In January 2019, active Python core developers elected a five-member Steering Council to lead
            the project.
            Python 2.0 was released on 16 October 2000, with many major new features such as list comprehensions,
            cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support. Python 3.0, released on 3
            December 2008, with many of its major features backported to Python 2.6.x and 2.7.x. Releases of Python 3
            include the 2to3 utility, which automates the translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.
            Python 2.7's end-of-life was initially set for 2015, then postponed to 2020 out of concern that a large body
            of existing code could not easily be forward-ported to Python 3. No further security patches or other
            improvements will be released for it. Currently only 3.7 and later are supported. In 2021, Python 3.9.2 and
            3.8.8 were expedited as all versions of Python (including 2.7) had security issues leading to possible
            remote code execution and web cache poisoning.
            In 2022, Python 3.10.4 and 3.9.12 were expedited and 3.8.13, and 3.7.13, because of many security issues.
            When Python 3.9.13 was released in May 2022, it was announced that the 3.9 series (joining the older series
            3.8 and 3.7) would only receive security fixes in the future.[62] On September 7, 2022, four new releases
            were made due to a potential denial-of-service attack: 3.10.7, 3.9.14, 3.8.14, and 3.7.14.
            As of November 2022, Python 3.11 is the stable release. Notable changes from 3.10 include increased program
            execution speed and improved error reporting.</p>

          <p>Python is a multi-paradigm programming language. Object-oriented programming and structured programming are
            fully supported, and many of their features support functional programming and aspect-oriented programming
            (including metaprogramming[66] and metaobjects). Many other paradigms are supported via extensions,
            including design by contract and logic programming.
            Python uses dynamic typing and a combination of reference counting and a cycle-detecting garbage collector
            for memory management. It uses dynamic name resolution (late binding), which binds method and variable names
            during program execution.
            Its design offers some support for functional programming in the Lisp tradition. It has filter,mapandreduce
            functions; list comprehensions, dictionaries, sets, and generator expressions.The standard library has two
            modules (itertools and functools) that implement functional tools borrowed from Haskell and Standard ML.</p>
