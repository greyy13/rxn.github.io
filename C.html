          <p>The C Programming Language (sometimes termed K&R, after its authors' initials) is a computer programming
            book written by Brian Kernighan and Dennis Ritchie, the latter of whom originally designed and implemented
            the language, as well as co-designed the Unix operating system with which development of the language was
            closely intertwined. The book was central to the development and popularization of the C programming
            language and is still widely read and used today. Because the book was co-authored by the original language
            designer, and because the first edition of the book served for many years as the de facto standard for the
            language, the book was regarded by many to be the authoritative reference on C.</p>

          <p>C was created by Dennis Ritchie at Bell Labs in the early 1970s as an augmented version of Ken Thompson's
            B. Another Bell Labs employee, Brian Kernighan, had written the first C tutorial, and he persuaded Ritchie
            to coauthor a book on the language. Kernighan would write most of the book's "expository" material, and
            Ritchie's reference manual became its appendices.
            The first edition, published February 22, 1978, was the first widely available book on the C programming
            language. Its version of C is sometimes termed K&R C (after the book's authors), often to distinguish this
            early version from the later version of C standardized as ANSI C.
            In April 1988, the second edition of the book was published, updated to cover the changes to the language
            resulting from the then-new ANSI C standard, particularly with the inclusion of reference material on
            standard libraries. The second edition of the book (and as of 2022, the most recent) has since been
            translated into over 20 languages. In 2012, an eBook version of the second edition was published in ePub,
            Mobi, and PDF formats.
            ANSI C, first standardized in 1989 (as ANSI X3.159-1989), has since undergone several revisions, the most
            recent of which is ISO/IEC 9899:2018 (also termed C17 or C18), adopted as an ANSI standard in June 2018.
            However, no new edition of The C Programming Language has been issued to cover the more recent standards.

          ><p>The influence of The C Programming Language on programmers, a generation of whom first worked with C in
            universities and industry, has led many to accept the authors' programming style and conventions as
            recommended practice, if not normative practice. For example, the coding and formatting style of the
            programs presented in both editions of the book is often referred to as "K&R style" or the "One True Brace
            Style" and became the coding style used by convention in the source code for the Unix and Linux kernels.</p>
