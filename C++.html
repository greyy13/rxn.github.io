          <p>C++ (/ˈsiː plʌs plʌs/, pronounced "C plus plus") is a high-level, general-purpose programming language
            created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup. First released in 1985 as an extension of the C
            programming language, it has since expanded significantly over time; modern C++ currently has
            object-oriented, generic, and functional features, in addition to facilities for low-level memory
            manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++
            compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Embarcadero, Oracle, and IBM.C++
            was designed with systems programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems in mind,
            with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights. C++ has also been found
            useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained
            applications,[14] including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search, or
            databases), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).
            C++ is standardized by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), with the latest standard
            version ratified and published by ISO in December 2020 as ISO/IEC 14882:2020 (informally known as C++20).
            The C++ programming language was initially standardized in 1998 as ISO/IEC 14882:1998, which was then
            amended by the C++03, C++11, C++14, and C++17 standards. The current C++20 standard supersedes these with
            new features and an enlarged standard library. Before the initial standardization in 1998, C++ was developed
            by Stroustrup at Bell Labs since 1979 as an extension of the C language; he wanted an efficient and flexible
            language similar to C that also provided high-level features for program organization.Since 2012, C++ has
            been on a three-year release schedule with C++23 as the next planned standard.</p>

          <p>In 1979, Bjarne Stroustrup, a Danish computer scientist, began work on "C with Classes", the predecessor to
            C++.The motivation for creating a new language originated from Stroustrup's experience in programming for
            his PhD thesis. Stroustrup found that Simula had features that were very helpful for large software
            development, but the language was too slow for practical use, while BCPL was fast but too low-level to be
            suitable for large software development. When Stroustrup started working in AT&T Bell Labs, he had the
            problem of analyzing the UNIX kernel with respect to distributed computing. Remembering his PhD experience,
            Stroustrup set out to enhance the C language with Simula-like features.C was chosen because it was
            general-purpose, fast, portable and widely used. As well as C and Simula's influences, other languages also
            influenced this new language, including ALGOL 68, Ada, CLU and ML.
            Initially, Stroustrup's "C with Classes" added features to the C compiler, Cpre, including classes, derived
            classes, strong typing, inlining and default arguments.</p>

          <p>According to Stroustrup, "the name signifies the evolutionary nature of the changes from C".This name is
            credited to Rick Mascitti (mid-1983) and was first used in December 1983. When Mascitti was questioned
            informally in 1992 about the naming, he indicated that it was given in a tongue-in-cheek spirit. The name
            comes from C's ++ operator (which increments the value of a variable) and a common naming convention of
            using "+" to indicate an enhanced computer program.
            During C++'s development period, the language had been referred to as "new C" and "C with Classes" before
            acquiring its final name.</p>
